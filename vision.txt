Comments:
  Must start at the beginning of a line.
  Are denoted with an '@' symbol

Every line can either be left blank, have a comment on it, or set a variable to
 some value

Types are determined by the value assigned.

All whitespace is ignored

All variables must be in the form:
    varName = value

Multiple variable names are not allowed.

Valid types for values:
  Integers: 0 - 9 (NOTE: all integers are treated as longs. If the value
                   specified exceeds the maximum value of a long for that
                   system, the value will overflow.)
  Floats:  0 - 9 or 0.0-9 9.0-9 (The same rules for integers apply for floats)
  Lists:  (SomeValue, ...) or [SomeValue, ...] (Lists can hold any number of
                                                values, however they must all be
                                                of the same type. If the type
                                                cannot be determined, then the
                                                type defaults to string).
  Strings: "Some text"

  If a value's type cannot be determined, then the type defaults to a string.

Every variable = value line MUST have at least one space or tab character before 
 and after the '=' sign.

Example:

@ This is a comment
@ This line (and the line above it), are ignored.

    path = "/var/logs"   <-- Type=string
 number=  10             <-- Type=integer
decimal  =9.35           <-- Type=float

someList = [10,5,222,31]   <-- Type=List of integers

badList = ["foo",10,232]   <-- Error

unknown = hello world      <-- Type=string
